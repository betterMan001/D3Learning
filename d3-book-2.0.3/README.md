## Version

**Important:** Make sure you are using the correct version of these sample files!  Otherwise, the code you see here may not exactly match what you see in the book.

This is version **2.0** of the examples, which should sync perfectly with what appears in the second edition. (Fingers crossed.)

For code shown in the **first edition of the book** (published March 2013), find version 1.0 on [the releases page](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/releases).
